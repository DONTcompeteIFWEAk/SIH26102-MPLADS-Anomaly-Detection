# SIH26102 — AI-Powered MPLADS Anomaly & Risk Detection System
## Comprehensive Project Explanation, Technical Architecture & Hackathon Judge Presentation Guide

---

# SECTION 1: The 30-Second Elevator Pitch (Say this directly to Judges)

> *"Respected Judges, under Problem Statement **SIH26102**, we have developed an **Enterprise AI-Powered MPLADS Anomaly and Risk Screening Platform**.*
>
> *Under the MPLAD Scheme, each Member of Parliament is allocated ₹5 Crore per year for local constituency development. Historically, CAG audit reports highlight recurring irregularities: **tender-splitting** to bypass mandatory open e-tenders, **repetitive ghost works** in the same village, and **severe administrative dormancy**.*
>
> *Rather than relying on toy synthetic datasets, our production system screens the **entire official national dataset of 56,138 public works worth ₹3,350 Crores across 557 Parliamentary Constituencies and 33 States/UTs**.*
>
> *We combine a **three-model unsupervised Machine Learning ensemble** (Isolation Forest, Profile-Deduplicated LOF, and PCA reconstruction) with **codified CAG statutory procurement rules** to deliver real-time hybrid risk scores, explainable root-cause diagnostics, an interactive What-If simulation lab, and automated CAG audit dossiers."*

# SECTION 2: Problem Statement & Real-World Context (SIH26102)

### What is MPLADS?
- **Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS)**: A Central Sector Scheme fully funded by the Government of India.
- Each MP can recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets (drinking water, primary education, public health, sanitation, roads, community facilities) up to **₹5 Crore per annum** in their constituency.
- The District Authority (District Collector / District Magistrate / Implementing District Authority - IDA) examines eligibility, sanctions works, selects implementing agencies, and executes projects.

### What are the Key Irregularities Highlighted by CAG Audits?
1. **Public Procurement Tender-Splitting (GFR 2017 Rule 149 Evasion)**:
   - Statutory rules mandate that works $\ge$ ₹5 Lakhs must undergo open competitive e-tendering.
   - Corrupt or collusive actors split a ₹15–20 Lakh project into multiple small contracts priced at **₹4.85 Lakh to ₹4.99 Lakh** to award contracts directly without tenders.
2. **Ghost Works & Localized Duplication Clusters**:
   - Recommending identical work descriptions (e.g. *"Installation of solar street lights"*) 4 to 10 times in the **exact same village or block** within narrow intervals.
3. **Severe Administrative Inaction & Dormancy (MPLADS Para 5.2)**:
   - Statutory SLA specifies works must be sanctioned within 45 days. In practice, thousands of recommended works sit in *"Action Pending"* or *"Unsanctioned"* status for over 180–365 days.
4. **Substantial Unspent Balances**:
   - Funds released by the Government of India accumulate idle in district bank accounts without timely execution, leading to negative interest drag and unutilized development capital.

5. **Cluster Repetitions (725)**: Flags instances where the exact same work description is repeated $\ge 3$ times in the same village/block within narrow timeframes.
6. **Data Quality Score (94.2%)**: Measures metadata transparency (penalizes records missing village, block, ward, or approval status).

#### B. Interactive Visualizations (Recharts)
- **Donut Chart (Hybrid Risk Classification)**:
  - **CRITICAL** (Red): $\ge 75$ (400 works, 0.7%)
  - **HIGH** (Orange): $55 - 74$ (6,148 works, 11.0%)

# SECTION 5: Step-by-Step Live Demo Script for Judges

Follow this exact flow during your live presentation:

### Step 1: Open the National Overview
- Point to the top bar: *"Judges, you can see our live database connection tracking 56,138 real MPLADS works."*
- Point to the KPI cards: *"Notice that out of ₹3,350 Crores monitored, our AI isolated 400 CRITICAL anomalies and 1,838 works showing contract-splitting patterns."*

### Step 2: Demonstrate the Works Anomaly Explorer
- Switch to the **Works Anomaly Explorer** tab.
- In the Risk Level dropdown, select **CRITICAL**.
- Show the judges: *"These are the highest-risk projects in India. Notice the signals column highlighting split-tenders and localized repetition."*
- Click **"Audit Deep-Dive"** on any work.
- Explain: *"Here is our explainability layer. It doesn't just give a black-box score; it explicitly tells the auditor that the allocation is 3.5x higher than the state median and mandates an inspection under GFR Rule 149."*
- Click **"Print Audit Dossier"** to show the formal CAG Audit Report.

### Step 3: Trigger the Live AI Simulator (The Winning Moment)
- Switch to the **Live AI Audit Simulator** tab.
- Tell the judges: *"Now, let's see how our AI evaluates a new proposal submitted by a district authority in real-time."*
- Click **"Scenario 1: Tender-Split Street Lights (Darbhanga)"**.
- Explain: *"Notice the allocation is ₹4,87,000—just below the ₹5,00,000 e-tendering threshold—and it has been recommended 4 times in the same village."*
- Click **"Run Real-Time AI Audit Analysis"**.
- Show the gauge animating to **85.4 CRITICAL**:
  *"In less than 50 milliseconds, our model flagged the evasion pattern and generated statutory action items for the auditor."*

# SECTION 6: Judge Q&A Cheat Sheet (Tough Questions & Winning Answers)

### Q1: "Is a high risk score proof of fraud or corruption?"
> **Winning Answer**: *"No, sir/ma'am. We adhere strictly to audit standards: **a risk score is screening intelligence, not a judicial conviction**. Our system is a human-in-the-loop decision-support platform designed to help overburdened CAG auditors prioritize which 400 projects to physically inspect out of 56,000."*

### Q2: "Why did you use unsupervised anomaly detection instead of supervised models like XGBoost or Random Forest?"
> **Winning Answer**: *"That is a fundamental domain constraint of public procurement. The official government portal does not contain a labeled 'fraud = 1' column. Training a supervised classifier on synthetic labels creates severe real-world bias. Unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest + LOF + PCA) calibrated with statutory CAG audit rules is the gold standard for real-world audit screening."*

### Q3: "What is Profile-Deduplicated LOF and why was it necessary?"
> **Winning Answer**: *"In real MPLADS data, many projects have identical descriptions and amounts (e.g., standard street lights). Standard Local Outlier Factor fails because multiple identical vectors result in a neighborhood distance of zero. We developed a profile-deduplication mapping that calculates local densities on unique behavioral feature vectors and maps them back, preventing zero-distance mathematical distortion."*

### Q4: "Can this scale to all government schemes (e.g., PMGSY, MGNREGA)?"
> **Winning Answer**: *"Absolutely. The architecture is completely modular. The data pipeline extracts financial amounts, dates, location hierarchies, and descriptions. By swapping the domain rule parameters, the same ensemble can screen MGNREGA muster rolls or PMGSY road contracts."*
